Resources for Workshops
================
 BhoneMyatKyaw created by this 
This is a repository to host all resources for workshops in a
chronological order. See below for the project tree structure.
Something you write down if you want to do something!!

##What is Git?
Developers who work on acommon codebase will clone the repository and then perform push and pull 
operations to synchronize their changes. In contrast , a fork creates a new codebase and 
updates to the fork are not  synchronized with the original repo.

``` r
fs::dir_tree(recurse = 2)
```
